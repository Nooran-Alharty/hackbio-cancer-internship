**`Immune Checkpoints in Cancer`**

            T cells are a type of white blood cells that play a key role in detecting abnormal cells in the body and destroying them; one type of those abnormal cells is, of course, cancerous cells. T cells use receptors to detect which cells to destroy. However they also have certain proteins existing on them called checkpoint proteins, such as Programmed cell Death 1 (PD1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) . These checkpoints ensure that T cells do not destroy the wrong cells by using a mechanism where if a ligand exists on another cell, such as PDL1 or PDL2, these ligands bind to the checkpoint and cause the inhibition of T cells.

“Tumors have hijacked inhibitory checkpoints to evade immune eradication” (A.H Sharpe, 2017)

Unfortunately, cancerous cells take advantage of that mechanism to protect themselves and avoid being detected by T cells, by using ligands on their surface to bind to the checkpoints on T cells. This led scientists to try and block off those checkpoints using what they call immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)s so that cancerous cells’ ligands can not bind to them and inhibit T cells. This leads to the patient body’s own immune system to start working effectively again and attack those cancerous cells. This method of treatment is a type of immune oncology treatment, which is a generally less invasive method than radiology or chemo therapy.  There are three different types of ICIs

“Three different groups of ICIs, including PD-1 inhibitors (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Cemiplimab), PDL-1 inhibitors. (Atezolimumab, Durvalumab and Avelumab), and CTLA-4 inhibitor (Ipilimumab) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of various types of cancer.”  (Shiravand et al., 2022)

 

This type of treatment has been used on several types of cancer, mainly metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers and non-small lung cancer. However, using ICIs in treatment is not a guarantee to recovery, in fact only around 20% to 40% of patients benefit from this treatment. Although the numbers may be disappointing this only emphasizes the need for further research, especially the importance of developing predictive biomarkers. Biomarkers are tell- tales inside our bodies, they are measurable indicators of biological state or condition. There are many biomarkers involved in checkpoint immunotherapy such as PD-L1 Expression as high PD-L1 expression often correlates with a better response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors like pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo). This helps scientist in predicting patient response and determining which patients are more likely to respond better to treatment.

In conclusion, cancerous cells exploit immune checkpoints to evade the immune system, but immune checkpoint inhibitors can block this, however to be able to help a larger percentage of patients, more research needs to be done.
